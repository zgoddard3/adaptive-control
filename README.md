# Adaptive Control Project Description

This repository contains my work for the final project of an adaptive controls course I took in Spring 2022. In this project I created three controllers for a planar model of a ducted fan. I started with a linear controller by linearizing the system at hover, then added adaptative control using MIMO DMRAC, and finally added non-linearities in the span of the control matrix. All code is contained in `project.m` and a detailed description of the project and results can be found in the [report file](Project_Report.pdf).
